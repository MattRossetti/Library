# Library Project

## Project Overview
This Project is part of The Odin Project's Full stack JavaScript course. It builds a simple library system to log what books users may have. Users can add books to their digital library by clicking the 'Add Book' button. This generates a card for each book added. Users can toggle each book card as read/unread or remove te books from the library.

## Lessons Learned
This was my first experience with Javascript objects. Javascript is used to store each book is as an object, and then each object is then stored in an array. This makes features like toggling read, updating the overview information, and removing the books a breeze as the information is stored in one place and can be accessed easily.
